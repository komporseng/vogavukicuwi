A lot of Japanese legend is just a variation of legends from China."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Its just a bunch of fans trying to put pieces that don't fit. If anything, Lugia is a Ziz, in Ecruteak city, an old man claims to have seen a silvery bird whose wings blocked out the sun heading to the Whirl Islands.<p>Seriously, I see this kind of randomness everywhere. Apparantly because Arceus is the "Creation" Pokemon, he is based off of the Christian God. The legendary pixies are also embodiments of the three powers that that God is said to hold omnipotence (Azelf), Omnipresense (Mesprit) and Omnimiscence (Uxie). Basically, fitting things that are not there. Other than Uxie, who is mentioned to be all knowing, none of the pixies are even mentioned to have such powers.</p><p>Oh, yeah and the whole Golduck = Kappa thing</p><p>If anyone is wondering where I got that from, its one of the many Bulbapedia pages created about legendary trios. Seriously, how much do we need? It just seems like a random insert by a fan who couldn't find the actual page for it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXai8bq%2FHoqWeq5Vitq%2Byy56sp5uVmXtzhZhrZ2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
