The story, of course, gives new meaning to “it’s complicated” in that Sheila had once shot the pair of them and left them for dead in an alley, but Finn continued to feel a connection with his bio mom despite her inhumane actions (not to mention her horrific history).<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Finn-Steffy-embrace-BB-HW.jpg alt="Finn Steffy B&B" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>But even in death, Sheila proved to be a point of contention between them when Finn decided that he’d like to attend the memorial Deacon put together in her honor. Steffy struggled to understand why on earth her husband would even entertain the idea of going, but took a step back knowing it might give him some kind of closure.</p><p>When Deacon started ranting about “ten toes” and saying Sheila might still be alive, Steffy and Finn were in agreement that the man was losing it, and seemed more bonded than ever. That said, it was Hope that Finn opened up to, admitting that he would rather Sheila hadn’t died at his wife’s hand.<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Finn-Hope-BB-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Steffy, meanwhile, talked through Deacon’s crazy talk with Liam, who didn’t miss the opportunity to remind her of how “fiercely” they loved each other and that a love like that doesn’t just go away — and that’s our jumping off point for the next chapter.<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liam-Steffy-header-BB-CBS.jpg alt width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Although Finn and Steffy will spend some quality time together without the kids this week, we can’t help but wonder if the lovey-dovey scenes will be a last hurrah for the couple before the powers that be split them up. Why? Because Finn’s next move is bound to alienate Steffy like nothing before.</p><p>Yup, just as Steffy is settling into life without the threat of Sheila lurking, and putting the stabbing behind her, Finn is on the cusp of making a decision what could bring all of it back into her life.<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Finn-BB-CBS_87e5d5.jpg alt=Finn width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Bold & Beautiful spoilers indicate that <a href=# rel=noopener>Deacon will reach out to Finn for assistance</a> on the heels of realizing that it was almost certainly Sheila’s lookalike, Sugar, who died, and not the former. With Sharpe on a mission to find Sheila and bring her back, Finn deciding to join him in the quest would, as they say, be a choice.</p><p>Thanks to our handy-dandy spoiler pic, we know that Finn will, in fact, take part in the mission to find Sheila and bring her home. Ironically, the search will lead them to an alley, where they’ll question a <a href=# rel=noopener>homeless guy named Tom, played by Clint Howard</a>, who will provide a clue as to the missing madwoman’s whereabouts.<br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Finn-Deacon-man-alley-BB-CBS.jpg alt="Finn Deacon Tom homeless man B&B" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>There’s no doubt in our minds that Deacon and Finn will eventually succeed in bringing Sheila home, and once Steffy learns that her husband was a willing and active participant, it could spell the end for “Sinn”.</p><p>Why? Finn riding to Sheila’s rescue is going to make her fixation on him 1000% worse. She’ll be more intent than ever on being a part of his life knowing he does care about her. Steffy will find it hard, if not impossible, to get past Finn riding for Team Deacon and not leaving well enough alone. Factor in Liam whispering in her ear about the grass being greener, and Hope being Finn’s confidante, and you have the perfect recipe for a break-up.</p><p><strong>Do you think “Sinn” will stay together if Finn helps bring Sheila home?
