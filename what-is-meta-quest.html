It <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spent $2 billion on the acquisition</a>, which also saw it expand into the hardware business. After it rebranded to Meta in a nod to its metaverse vision, Facebook started rebranding Oculus products.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Meta Quest vs. Oculus Quest</h2><p>The virtual reality headsets that Facebook built sold under the Oculus brand. Following the Meta Platforms rebrand, Oculus was renamed Meta Quest.

The latest version of the device, Meta Quest 2 (or just "Quest 2"), offers many improvements over the original headset. It comes with a faster processor and higher resolution, but it's lighter in weight and $100 cheaper than its predecessor.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another major difference between Meta Quest 2 and Oculus Quest is that Quest 2 requires users to have a Facebook account.

As more people adopt the device, developers are launching more games for it. Some of the best Quest games to play are Puzzling Places ($15), which lets you pick an object, break it into 400 pieces and rebuild it as a puzzle, Down the Rabbit Hole ($25), which involves escaping a trap after destroying the Queen of Hearts' birthday party, and Moss ($30) which is about a little mouse trying to save its community.</p><p>The <a href=#>metaverse economy</a> is predicted to grow to as much as $30 trillion in the next decade.
