Hairstylist <strong>Shelby Swain</strong> and makeup artist <strong>Alexx Mayo</strong>. While vision boards, an on-the-go beauty store and many outfit changes are needed for the Instagram glam sessions, the shoots have actually been fairly spontaneous.</p><p class=p1>Back in February 2021, when Lizzo debuted an absolutely absurd yet totally amazing 9-foot long ponytail, Swain told Us Weekly: “In the pandemic, I have much more time to be creative and be free. Lizzo has always spoken to me about trying to step out and do more shoots to show off her hair.
