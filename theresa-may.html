She even was famously quoted as saying that it should no longer be called the “Nasty Party.”Likewise, she served in several Shadow Cabinets before becoming Home Secretary in 2010. She had also become the Minister for Women and Equalities, a post she vacated in 2012.</p><p>After Prime Minister David Cameron announced his resignation, May announced his candidacy for the Conservative Party and quickly emerged as its Leader, receiving 50% of the votes alone in Parliament amid the other candidates.</p><h4>‘Brexit’ and PM Candidacy</h4><p>Surprisingly half of the citizens of the UK voted to exit the European Union in June 2016 — an event which is referred to as the “Brexit” (Britain Exit) referendum.&nbsp; There, she originally voted to remain in the E.U., although she was known to be a “Euroskeptic.” However, she announced her candidacy for the Conservative Party after Prime Minister David Cameron announced his resignation.

Unfortunately, within days, Leadsom, who voted for Britain to leave the E.U., pulled out of the running due to distasteful remarks she made about why she would make a better PM. Without any other contesting her candidacy, she was set to be sworn in as the first post-Brexit female Prime Minister.</p><h5>Saying at the Parliament</h5><p>Additionally, Theresa May had even made a televised announcement surrounded by Members of Parliament and her husband Philip, about seeing Brexit through on July 11, 2016, saying,</p><p>“During this campaign, my case has been based on three things. First, the need for strong, proven leadership to steer us through what will be difficult and uncertain economic and political times. The need, of course, to negotiate the best deal for Britain in leaving the E.U. and to forge a new role for ourselves in the world. Brexit means Brexit. And we are going to make a success of it.”</p><p>“Second, we need to unite our country. And third, we need a strong, new positive vision for the future of our country. A vision of a country that works, not for the privileged few, but that works for every one of us. Because we’re going to give people more control over their lives. And that’s how, together, we will build a better Britain.”</p><h4>Reign as Prime Minister</h4><p>May was sworn in as Britain’s second female Prime Minister on July 13, 2016. As well as the Queen’s 13th Prime Minister following ceremonial overtures.</p><p>On May 29, 2017, Prime Minister May officially told Parliament that she had invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, legislation triggering the legal process to set Brexit in motion. “This is a historic moment from which there can be no turning back. Britain is leaving the European Union,” she said. “We are going to make our own decisions and our laws. We will take control of the most important things for us. And we will take this opportunity to build a stronger, fairer Britain — a country that our kids and grandkids are proud to call home. union.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-19533 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Theresa-May-with-the-world-cup.jpg alt="Theresa May" width=650 height=434 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-19533 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Theresa May with the World Cup team of England (Source: Instagram)</p><p>Shortly afterward, on June 8, an early general election resulted in the loss of her Conservative Party’s Parliamentary majority.

Due to the businesses applying pressure on the government to provide a clear strategy, the cabinet aimed to hash out differences on whether to go for “clean” separation. And had to strike new trade deals, or retain close access to the single market.</p><h4>Historic Defeat</h4><p>By the year 2019, just 10 weeks before Britain was scheduled to leave the bloc, she had suffered a historic defeat in Parliament.
