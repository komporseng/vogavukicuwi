Today (August 28), the legend announced eleven additional artists who will join the lineup to salute the musical icon as he closes this chapter of his legendary career.</p><p>Newly-announced guest entertainers are <strong>Trace Adkins, Ricky Skaggs, Steven Curtis Chapman, Ray Stevens, Pam Tillis, The Gatlin Brothers, Hunter Hayes, Mark Wills, The McCrary Sisters, The Los Lonely Boys</strong> and<strong> Elizabeth Cook.</strong></p><p>“I’m so excited about my last show in Nashville at Bridgestone Arena and the amazing lineup of artists,” says Milsap. “I love Nashville and the amazing career my fans have given me. ‘I wouldn’t have missed it for the world!’ Please join me. It will be a very special night.”</p><p>Previously-announced performers include <strong>Kelly Clarkson, Little Big Town, Parker McCollum, Justin Moore, Scotty McCreery, Tracy Lawrence, Randy Houser, Sara Evans, Lorrie Morgan, Neal McCoy, BRELAND, Phil Vassar, Terri Clark, The Band of Heathens</strong> and<strong> Charlie McCoy.</strong> <strong>Sixwire</strong> will serve as the house band. The evening will honor Milsap and his 50-plus year career, his celebrated catalog and his lasting influence on country music. Ticket holders can expect several special surprise guest performances.</p><p>Milsap has amassed an astounding forty No. 1 hits with 50 years of charted singles. He created a new way of recording music (being blind – his hyper-attuned hearing led him to develop and build what is now known as ‘Ronnie’s Place’), he crossed genre lines and became one of the biggest Pop/Country/Americana and even R&B artists of the late ’70s and early ’80s.</p><p>In addition, Milsap has been honored with six Grammy Awards, four Album of the Year Awards and was a Country Music Association (CMA) Entertainer of the Year. His single, “She Loves My Car,” was the first country music video played on MTV.</p><p>“We are thrilled to host the Ronnie Milsap Tribute concert,” adds Bridgestone Arena Chief Venues Officer <strong>David Kells.</strong> “With over 50 years of music and 40 #1 hits, this celebration is going to be something special. Thank you to the Outback Presents team for curating such an amazing event.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfJdoaXFnYWiGd32VZqmopp6esq61y6yYqWWkp7ajwdOeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
