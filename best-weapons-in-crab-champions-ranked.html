That said, here are the best weapons in Crab Champions.</p><p>Recommended Videos</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Best Weapons in Crab Champions, Ranked</h2><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>Crab Champions is an impressive game with a lot of variety thanks to the weapon choices and mods that can be acquired in each run. While <strong>each weapon has been buffed and nerfed</strong> (and will continue to get that treatment) and the mods you get can really make or break a weapon, here is the base ranking of every weapon in Crab Champions.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire Survivors: Best Weapons Tier List</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>D-Tier Crab Champions Weapons</h3><ul data-found-items=2 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true><li>Orb Launcher</li><li>Rocket Launcher</li></ul><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>The worst weapon in the game is definitely the <strong>Rocket Launcher</strong>. Grenade builds are very strong and do everything a Rocket Launcher can, but better. The <strong>Orb Launcher</strong> is high D-tier because it’s an easy weapon to use, but it doesn’t deal nearly enough damage.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>C-Tier Crab Champions Weapons</h3><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Most of the weapons in Crab Champions are viable options, which means<strong> there aren’t any weapons in the C-tier</strong>. While there are a few weapons that are currently really bad, most of the weapons in the game are in great positions.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>B-Tier Crab Champions Weapons</h3><ul data-found-items=3 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false><li>Cluster Launcher</li><li>Pistol</li><li>Auto Rifle</li></ul><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>The <strong>Auto Rifle</strong> is the most neutral weapon in the game. It’s not bad, it’s not great. Any build can be paired with it to moderate success. The <strong>Pistol</strong> is now dual wield and can deal a lot of damage, but there are better alternatives.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>The <strong>Cluster Launcher </strong>is high B-tier because it has a lot of splash damage which can make quick work of hordes, but it isn’t the best weapon for eliminating bosses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>A-Tier Crab Champions Weapons</h3><ul data-found-items=4 data-current-count=160 data-injectable=false><li>Crossbow</li><li>Shotgun Pistol</li><li>Pump Shotgun</li><li>Sniper</li></ul><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>The <strong>Sniper</strong> is low A-tier because, with the right perks, it can be S-tier but on its own, it can be hard to master. It has a high skill ceiling and steep learning curve, but can be an extremely high damage-dealing weapon.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>The <strong>Pump Shotgun</strong> is an amazing weapon in all circumstances. The <strong>Shotgun Pistol</strong> is just a smidge higher because it has a higher rate of fire which makes for quicker kills. Both of the shotgun options are some of the best weapons in the game.</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>The <strong>Crossbow</strong> is high A-tier because it starts out in an amazing spot that can annihilate hordes of enemies as well as bosses. The Crossbow’s current state makes you feel like a bullet hell boss.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>S-Tier Crab Champions Weapons</h3><ul data-found-items=3 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false><li>Minigun</li><li>Blade Launcher</li><li>Burst Pistol</li></ul><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>The <strong>Burst Pistol </strong>makes the S-tier because it has extremely high damage and a consistent rate of fire. It’s similar to the Shotgun Pistol, but the Burst Pistol gets the job done quicker and is an amazing foundation for any build.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>The <strong>Blade Launcher</strong> is next because it has high damage and each blade will ricochet and eliminates every enemy in the area. This weapon cuts through enemies with ease which allows you to survive for much longer.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=false>At the top of S-tier is the <strong>Minigun</strong>. This weapon absolutely shreds the competition. The Minigun has high damage and the highest rate of fire. Any build can be used to enhance the Minigun since it is already the best weapon in the game.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
