His Family Information</span></h2><p>Shelly Clark is Fred White’s wife.

He and Maurice shared a mother, Edna White, a housewife. His father, Verdine Sr., was a podiatrist.</p><p>Fred began playing the drums at the age of nine. Maurice coined the term “child prodigy” for him. Fred, like Verdine Jr., changed his last name to White to make it more evident that he was connected to Maurice.</p><p>According to Fred, who told Modern Drummer magazine in 1982 that he grew up “in the ghetto of Chicago,” drums provided him with a sense of purpose.</p><p>He began doing shows when he was just 13 years old. At the age of 14, he joined a band that performed in bars.</p><p>He began performing with soul musician Donny Hathaway at the age of 15 and making up excuses for missing sessions due to school.</p><h2><span id=Fred_White8217s_Pre-Death_Net_Worth>Fred White’s Pre-Death Net Worth</span></h2><p>Fred had a net worth of around $2 million at the time of his death, according to opoyi.com.

Fred, you’re still a teen.</p><p>Mr. White also has a sister named Geri, in addition to Verdine. Maurice White, 74, died in 2016. The total number of survivors was not immediately known.</p><p>Maurice described Fred as a “daredevil spirit” who was “cocky, young, and a little bit arrogant” and generated problems with his bandmates, notably owing to the unusual circumstance of having two drummers perform onstage at the same time in his memoirs.</p><p>Because he was “used to being the only drummer and carrying the band,” Fred White revealed to Modern Drummer that his early years of sharing drumming duties with Mr. Johnson were a “struggle.”</p><h3><span id=Also_Read_Wife_Girlfriend_And_Family_Of_Adam_G_Sevani><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
