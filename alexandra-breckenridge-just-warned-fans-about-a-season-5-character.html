After a slight delay, <a href=#>the series’ fifth season</a> has begun filming in Vancouver. <a href=#>What’s On Netflix</a>&nbsp;is reporting that filming began July 1, 2022. Apparently, the season will take about five months to film and end around November 30th, 2022.</p><p>This means it will follow almost the exact timeline for season 4 and will likely debut in July 2023.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p></p><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/14XPbFSWUTU?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><h2>Alexandra Breckenridge just warned fans about a season 5 character</h2><p>When the series does return, <a href=#>Breckenridge has already warned</a> fans about a sinister new character coming into town to shake things up. In Season 4, we met Melissa (played by Barbara Pollard), the sister of town favorite Nick (Keith MacKechnie), and sister-in-law, Jo Ellen (Gwynyth Walsh). As we know, Jack and Nick have decided to go into a glamping business together, but Melissa has control of the family’s trust. We also know that she is somehow connected to drug kingpin Calvin (David Cubitt) and that she posted Brady’s (Ben Hollingsworth) bail anonymously.</p><p>“Nick and Melissa getting involved in this glamping business may or may not become problematic for Jack,” Breckenridge told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Line</a>. “I’m not sure what her intention is yet, [but] she obviously doesn’t have good intentions. I’m not entirely clear if Nick is oblivious to what Melissa does or if he knows. He seems like such a kind guy. I definitely don’t think his wife has a damn clue. She would probably have told the entire town by now.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p></p><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/PfZ3KaX5CiA?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><h2 id=h-virgin-river-season-5-could-have-a-major-time-jump>‘Virgin River’ Season 5 could have a major time jump</h2><p>Typically Virgin River only has about a week or two between seasons. Though the series is entering its 5th run, only a couple of months have passed in the timeline of the story. “Things move slowly in Virgin River,” Breckenridge told&nbsp;<a href=#>Glamour.</a>&nbsp;“I think Mel’s only been in Virgin River for maybe four months,” Breckenridge guesses. “It’s a hundred and some odd days; there’s a chart for it. She’s only nine weeks pregnant at this point, and Charmaine is like five months, apparently.”</p><p>However, since fans will likely want to see the birth of Jack and Mel’s baby girl sooner rather than later and discover the true father of <a href=#>Charmaine’s unborn twins</a>, it’s likely that there will be a pretty big time jump.</p><p>After all, it feels like Charmaine has been pregnant for centuries, and no one wants to do that all over again for Mel.</p><p><strong>RELATED:<a href=#>&nbsp;‘Virgin River’: Was Hope’s Car Crash Really an Accident?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOmqOesJGjsbOtjJupnpubmruztcOgnGaipajBbsPAq6WenF2brq%2B%2FjJqZqK2kYq5uv8SaqqimXWp6pLTAq5icrJWnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
