plank position and tucking your leg in towards your stomach.</p><img decoding=async id=i-3e8e5e73b1a280aa

performed by dropping your hips from side to side while maintaining a strong plank position.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Without taking a break, she moves onto bunny hops followed by ‘in and out’ reaches.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>These are performed by starting in a high boat position with your back straight, then leaning back slowly and bringing yourself back up with your knees to your chest.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Ting follows this with a round of roll-up toe taps, side plank crunch dips and sprinter sit-ups, which are just like regular sit-ups with your legs stretched straight out in front.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She ends the workout with a set of contralaterals – which involve assuming a plank position and raising opposite arms and legs off the floor at the same time while keeping your back straight and your core engaged – and bicycle crunches.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her final move is the crunch pulse, which are similar to half sit-ups.</p><img decoding=async id=i-49df0690d16d5ac6
