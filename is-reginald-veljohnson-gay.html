His character Winslow is adored by viewers all across the world. Even when he has nothing to do with an interview, people try to find a way to learn more about the well-known TV parent.</p><p>When VelJohnson’s TV son, Darius McCrary, sat down to discuss the program with the Comedy Hype, he was questioned about if VelJohnson’s sexual orientation had ever come up when he was on Family Matters.</p><p>The actor declared categorically that he has never understood why people are offended by someone’s sexual orientation or personal preferences.</p><p>Additionally, McCrary said he was not a fan of the media dictating how people are portrayed and what the audience thinks.</p><h2><span id=an_alleged_relationship_with_James_Avery>an alleged relationship with James Avery</span></h2><p>While James Avery struggled to play Uncle Phil on Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, VelJohnson was doing a fantastic job as Winslow on Family Matters. In addition to being at the height of their professions, they were ranked as the best three out of gay black actors. They were mostly included on the latter list because of rumors of an illicit relationship.</p><p>Yes, you did read that right. At the time, there were many rumors that TV fathers Winslow and Philip Banks were dating. And it stoked the fire even further in 2014 when Winslow was surprised by Uncle Phil on the set of Family Matters.</p><p>The rumors stopped after Avery got married. Both performers refuted any reports and choose to remain silent despite the fact that some people think it was an open secret and others question their relationship. Sadly, the talented actor passed away in 2014 as a result of open-heart surgery complications.</p><p>What could be worse than continuously having your sexuality questioned? Death’s trick! According to rumors, VelJohnson passed away in February 2017 after having a heart attack. He was on a flight from London to Los Angeles when emergency personnel removed him and took him to a nearby hospital to receive treatment for cardiac arrest.</p><p>The actor is still alive and healthy, thus it was determined that everything was a fraud. He discussed the significance of the legendary show Family Matters with TV One TV on its 30th anniversary.</p><p>\Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
