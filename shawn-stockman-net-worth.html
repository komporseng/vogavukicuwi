Stockman is also part of the television show “The Sing-Off” on which he works as a judge alongside <a href=#>Ben Folds</a> and Jewel Kilcher. All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Shawn Stockman? As of mid-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $70 million, mostly earned through his success with Boyz II Men; he also writes songs and owns his own record label, and as he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will increase.</p><h3>Shawn Stockman Net Worth $70 million</h3><p>Stockman’s passion for singing started when he joined the Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale at the age of eight. He attended the Creative and Performing Arts High School (CAPA) in South Philadelphia, where he met the other members of Boyz II Men thanks to being a vocal major.</p><p>Shawn started to gain popularity through the vocal group Boyz II Men, which became known for their acapella songs and ballads; they were previously a quartet with Stockman being one of the tenors of the group. They found international success in the 1990s, which began with the single “End of the Road” becoming a chart topping hit in the Billboard Hot 100 top spot for 13 weeks, breaking <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>’s decades old record. They would continue to break this record with subsequent releases, releasing the songs “I’ll Make Love to You” and “One Sweet Day” which featured <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a>, which still holds the record for being at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 at 16 weeks. They’ve been called the fourth most successful musical group of the 1990s, having a cumulative Billboard record just behind <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a>, The Beatles and <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>. However in 2003, <a href=#>Michael McCary</a> left the group because of health concerns. The remaining trio continue to produce records today and still regularly perform at various events.</p><p>During the 1990s, Shawn also had a solo album side project but it was never released. He also wrote songs for the Disney movie “Seventeen Again” including “Hot Thing” and “Forever”, and then for other projects such as the film “Mr. Holland’s Opus”. Eventually, Stockman created his own record label entitled Soul Chemistry Projects, on which he did a cover of <a href=#>Beyonce</a>’s song “If I Were a Boy”.</p><p>One of his latest endeavours is being part of the show “The Sing-Off”, with host <a href=#>Nick Lachey</a>; he’s been a judge of the show since the first season, and has shared the panel with <a href=#>Ben Folds</a>, <a href=#>Nicole Scherzinger</a>, <a href=#>Sara Bareilles</a>, and Jewel Kilcher. The show premiered in 2009 and has aired a total of four seasons.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Stockman married Sharonda Jones in 2001, and they have three children. He is the cousin of singer Anthony David.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=27.553413654618><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Shawn Stockman</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$70 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 26, 1972</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Songwriter, Music Producer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Sharonda Jones (m. 2001)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Brooklyn Stockman, Ty Stockman, Micah Stockman</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Siblings</td><td>Chris Stockman, Rodney Stockman, Steven Stockman, Two Stockman, Thurman Stockman, Taterea Stockman, Deborah Stockman, David Stockman, Marks Stockman</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>Shawn Patrick Stockman , Stockman, Shawn , Boys II Men , Boyz II Men</td></tr><tr readability=0.34042553191489><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/shawnstockmaan</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.29166666666667><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/shawnstockman?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0830892/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.24242424242424><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/shawn-stockman-mn0000011426</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Awards for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals -
