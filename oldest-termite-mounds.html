Recently, researchers working in Namaqualand in western South Africa discovered termite mounds dating back 34,000 years, making them the oldest in the world. Alongside dating the termite mounds, scientists studied how their high carbon content affects their local environment. Interestingly, their research holds promise for future climate change studies."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

KG / Alamy Stock Photo</span><span class=caption-body>An example of much younger termite mounds in the Australian Outback.</span></p><p>“To put it in perspective, these termite mounds were already ancient when woolly mammoths still roamed the Earth,” said Francis. “During the Last Glacial Maximum, around 20,000 years ago, massive ice sheets covered parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. These mounds were already thousands of years old by then, providing a living archive of environmental conditions that shaped our world.”</p><p>The impressive mounds, called heuweltjies (“little hills”) in Afrikaans, were found near the Buffels River in Namaqualand. This region is a hotbed for termites, and nearly 20 percent of the area is covered in the insects’ mounds. This makes it a key site for both the study of termite mounds and how they interact with their environment.</p><p>In fact, Francis believes research surrounding termite mounds may help develop future policies when it comes to slowing climate change.</p><h2>How Termite Mounds May Help In The Fight Against Climate Change</h2><p>Francis and her team originally set out to study the termite mounds in Namaqualand to collect information about how their high carbon content changes the surrounding environment.</p><p>Every day, termites collect wood and add it to their nests, which can grow more than six feet tall. As time passes, the wood eventually decays, creating a carbon-rich environment beneath the ground.</p><p>“The heuweltjies have shown that during their formation, the region experienced significantly more rainfall than today. This wetter climate allowed for minerals such as calcite and gypsum to dissolve and move down to the groundwater. This process is crucial in understanding natural carbon sequestration processes,” Francis stated.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-497044 alt="Southern Harvester Termite" width=700 height=949 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/southern-harvester-termite.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-497044 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Nicola van Berkel/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The insects that made the ancient mounds are southern harvester termites (Microhodotermes viator).</span></p><p>According to the researchers’ study, published in the journal <a href=# rel=noopener>Science of the Total Environment</a>, the termite mounds sequester carbon dioxide as part of the termites’ harvesting activities.</p><p>When a termite brings new material into the mound, it forces older material closer to the bottom, where its carbon content is better preserved. Because these nests disturb the soil, rainwater seeps into the mounds, and microbes in the soil convert the carbon into calcium carbonate. This calcium carbonate interacts with carbonic acid during heavy rains to create carbon dioxide, which is then stored underground.</p><p>This strange carbon storage model is something researchers have been interested in for a while.</p><p>“By studying these mounds, scientists can gain a better understanding of how to combat climate change, utilizing nature’s own processes for carbon sequestration,” said Francis. “They also highlight the importance of preserving our natural world, as these tiny engineers have been shaping our environment for tens of thousands of years.”</p><p>After reading about the world’s oldest termite mounds, dive into the terrifying story of <a href=#>cordyceps</a>, the fungus that turns insects into zombies.
