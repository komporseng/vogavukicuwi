He lays down [bait] for two to three hours before he says, ‘I’m the messiah.’ After doing that, when he says those words, many believers respond. That’s how you get sucked in. It’s a type of gaslighting," Kyoungyoon shared of his and his family's experience with the controversial JMS leader.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;</strong><span><a href=#>K-Pop Star Jamie Blasts Alleged Cheater Boyfriend on Instagram</a></span></p><p>A recent Netflix documentary called In&nbsp;the Name of God: A Holy Betrayal highlighted the church's controversies, which led to the exposure of members' addresses, including a restaurant owned by Lee Kyoungyoon's parents.</p><p><a href=#>Allkpop</a> reports Kyoungyoon said he was born into the cult, where he was brainwashed.</p><p>"I think I was brainwashed little by little at JMS. Because my family believed it…I didn’t even have anything to compare it to," Kyoungyoon shared, revealing that a medical emergency when he was in the second grade reinforced his family's belief in the church.</p><p>"When I was in second grade, there was fluid in my brain. I couldn’t eat anything and kept throwing up. A bunch of pastors came from afar to pray [for me]. Then three days later, I went for an examination to get surgery, but they said there were no problems. After that day, I think my mother believed her faith was real," he explained.</p><p>Regarding Jung Myung Seok's crimes, Kyoungyoon claimed he was taught to believe that the leader was "falsely accused," even when he was arrested.</p><p>"They teach so many reasons why he’s innocent. It’s almost indoctrination. I think that’s how I was brainwashed to think, 'Ah, Jung Myung Seok is being persecuted like God' ... I believed he wasn’t someone who would do that. I am so ashamed of myself for thinking that," he elaborated.</p><p>Kyoungyoon added he kept his association with JMS a secret from his bandmates, agency, friends and fanbase, sharing he could "not dare face our fans" and that he and his family have since left the church.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>K-Pop Groups Who Disbanded</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kuG68zqlkpZ2VYri6u9SnnrKnn6N6q7nSZpqupKRiw6qv06KkaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
