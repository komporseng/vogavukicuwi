The Jets did not trade any of their players or acquire anyone in a trade, letting the deadline pass. It was not because general manager Joe Douglas did not try.
Douglas inquired about wide receivers like Davante Adams and Mike Evans, but the Raiders and Buccaneers were not willing to trade them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s where we are.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Davante Adams <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The Jets are 4-3 and are in the AFC playoff hunt.</p><p>Despite losing Aaron Rodgers in Week 1, the Jets have been <a href=#>able to salvage their season</a> and are riding a three-game winning streak.</p><p>It is clear the offense could use an upgrade, but the Jets could not find one.</p><p>The Jets made repeated inquiries about Evans and Adams, according to sources, but were told neither was available.</p><p>The Raiders were willing to trade Hunter Renfrow, but the Jets were more interested in adding an outside receiver than a slot receiver, especially with Renfrow making $11 million this season.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Mike Evans <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The Jets also need help along the offensive line after losing center Connor McGovern (knee) and guard Wes Schweitzer (calf) to injured reserve this week.</p><p>But there were not many linemen available. The Vikings traded guard Ezra Cleveland to the Jaguars for a sixth-round pick.</p><p>A source said the Jets did talk to the Vikings about Cleveland but felt he was not a good fit for their style of play.</p><p>Minnesota benched Cleveland a few weeks ago, so no one should act like the Jets passed on a sure thing.</p><p>“I won’t get into specific conversations but I will say that we had a lot of talks with a lot of teams on a lot of players at a lot of different positions,” Douglas said when asked about Cleveland. “Ultimately, at the end of the day, we did what we felt was best for the team. We’re excited about the guys we have.”</p><p>The Jets did add one offensive linemen, but not through a trade.</p><p>They signed veteran Rodger Saffold to the practice squad with the intention of him moving to the active roster at some point.</p><p>Saffold was a Pro Bowl alternate last year after starting all season for the Bills. He played for Jets offensive line coach Keith Carter in Tennessee.</p><p>“Rodger is an experienced guy, who has played a lot of games,” Douglas said. “Tough, smart. He knows Keith Carter well, being with him in Tennessee. He’s the exact type of person, competitor, mental makeup, toughness that we’re looking for, to add to the group. I think he’s going to be a really good acquisition for us.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Joe Douglas’ attempts at deadline moves were not fruitful. <span class=credit>Bill Kostroun/New York Post</span></figure><p>In terms of selling, the two players the Jets had been willing to move were defensive end Carl Lawson and running back Dalvin Cook.</p><p>Neither is playing much and both have expressed frustration with their limited roles. The Jets could not find any interested buyers, though, with the money that both players are still due.</p><p>“We had talks with a lot of teams,” Douglas said. “Ultimately, we did what we felt was best for the team. Those guys are great teammates and great players. I have a feeling we’re going to need those guys a lot down the stretch. They’re assets to the team and we’re glad they’re here.”</p><p>Douglas did touch on something non-trade related.</p><p>He said the team has had talks about extending edge rusher Bryce Huff, who his scheduled to be a free agent in March.</p><p>“There have been some informal conversations with Bryce’s representatives,” Douglas said. “They’re trending in a positive direction. There’s still a long way to go. Bryce is another, not to pontificate, but that’s an unbelievable player-development story. For him to come in as an undrafted free agent and just work and work and work and get better every day. I think the last two years you’ve really been able to see a huge progression for him. Everyone’s excited about Bryce.”n and Jason Brownlee on Sunday and elevated Malik Taylor from the practice squad with Randall Cobb sidelined by a shoulder injury.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmbGlfqL2wvtOsZqOdpKh6tMDAp5tmqJGpeqLAjKedpWWkp66lsYydnJqcnJ67pnnAn6ueql2Zrq3CyKdknKefoHq0vMScrKWZpJ68r3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
