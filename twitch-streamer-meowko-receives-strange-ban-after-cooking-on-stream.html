As of the time of writing, she has <a href=#>over 275,000 followers on Twitch</a>.</p><p>For years, Twitch would not give streamers the reasons why they had been banned. This finally changed on August 9, 2021, when Twitch&nbsp;confirmed that more details would be given after a ban was issued. This meant that streamers could learn the name and date of the stream that got them banned, which proved beneficial&nbsp;in helping streamers make cases to lift bans on their accounts, especially those who stream regularly. The change also served to shed light on some flaws in Twitch’s banning system, which has seen users banned for a range of reasons, from intimate shaving on stream to <a href=#>Twitch watch party DMCA strikes</a>.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="CS:GO Twitch Streamer Banned For Intimate Shaving During Match" href=#>CS:GO Twitch Streamer Banned For Intimate Shaving During Match</a></span></p><p>Taking to Twitter to share news of her ban, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meowko</a>&nbsp;shared both her frustration and confusion over the reasons Twitch gave her, noting she “got banned for wearing gym clothes while cooking” (via <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dexerto</a>). Seen in screenshots shared by the streamer in a follow-up tweet, the Twitch stream reportedly came under fire for featuring&nbsp;“someone that is wearing a speedo or bikini while cooking.” Meowko has done streams in the past about fitness, going to spas while wearing bikinis, and cooking, so that particular reason came as a surprise to both her and her fans. The more confusing reason Twitch stated was for “using an Augmented Reality avatar on stream that has insufficient coverage,”&nbsp;as Meowko reiterated that she doesn’t use avatars of any kind on her streams. It seems the situation was resolved fairly quickly, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meowko</a> later tweeting that she’d been unbanned by Twitch.</p><p>While things were resolved for the streamer in a relatively timely manner, Meowko is one of <a href=#>many banned Twitch&nbsp;content creators</a> to deal with this frustration. There’s been no shortage of creators who’ve received bans for&nbsp;alleged breaches of the platform’s terms of service, but that have later been disputed, often with the help of viewers who rally around those they believe have been banned unfairly.&nbsp;Bans often revolve around what Twitch streamers wear, with many believing Twitch’s rules for clothing&nbsp;are outdated.</p><p>While Twitch streaming is a fun hobby for some, it’s a career for others, so bans like&nbsp;Meowko’s aren’t only an inconvenience but a threat to their livelihood. Many streamers turn to their audience on Twitch for support, hosting donation streams to raise money for essentials such as rent or medical bills. Whether they stream in addition to another job or stream exclusively, <a href=#><strong>Twitch</strong> is a career for many content creators</a> so these surprise bans have many people&nbsp;concerned if they will get one next. Lots of streamers are still hoping for the platform to reconsider what should constitute a ban.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Twitch Streamers Invited To Catch 1 Million Pokémon For Charity" href=#>Twitch Streamers Invited To Catch 1 Million Pokémon For Charity</a></span></p><p>Source:&nbsp;Meowko/Twitter&nbsp;(<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>) (via <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dexerto</a>)</p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>Xbox Has The Best Response To Today’s PlayStation Plus News</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Devin Connelly<br><span class=amount>(2 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Devin Connelly is a freelance gaming writer for Screen Rant.
