Whether it has been how to use my printer, or it has been watching how to be a considerate activist. This is the place to talk about important things that matter. It does not mean that there is not also silly content, that there are ways for me to express myself. But, there will be deep conversations as well, anti-racist rhetoric and inclusive content.’</p><p><a href=#>Brie</a> then states that this first video was just her getting a feel of what it’s like to do this kind of thing and also chatting with some ‘brilliant creators.’</p><p></p><p>As mentioned before, she also gets candid about having social anxiety and being an introvert.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘For me, my baseline has been, I’m an introvert with asthma. Like, that’s been my story for myself…I’m introverted, I’m scared, I have social anxiety. And through, in particular, playing Captain Marvel, that like kind of wiped clean those titles I had for myself and made me go, ‘Woah, I’m not really that anymore.’ And so, from there I found that speaking out, telling my story, talking about things that I’m scared of, has just helped me so much.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSp7amecuaqaynnmK0psDSZpqappSesW6twaisrWWjqb%2B2s8aloKefXay2tbSMrKacoZGheqK616KcrbFdpLtutMSrZKedp2LGsMHTrpmeZZOdrq%2B6xKVkbWliaIR0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
